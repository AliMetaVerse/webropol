# Tabbed Interface Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a seamless dual-mode interface for Webropol that allows users to switch between a Classic Interface and an AI Prompt Interface using tabbed navigation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Tab Navigation
- **Classic Interface Tab**: Displays the standard visual UI with action cards
- **AI Prompt Interface Tab**: Opens a prompt-based interface for natural language commands
- Smooth transitions between tabs with fade and slide animations
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Space)
- ARIA roles and accessibility attributes
- Focus management with visible focus indicators

### 2. Classic Interface (Default)
- Maintains the existing card-based layout
- Action cards for Surveys, Events, AI Text Analysis, and Feedback Management
- Visual consistency with the current design system
- All existing functionality preserved

### 3. AI Prompt Interface
Features include:
- **Survey Type Selection**: 8 different survey types (Survey, Event, Feedback, Assessment, Quiz, Poll, Form, Research)
- **Large Prompt Area**: Multi-line textarea with character counter
- **Contextual Help**: Expandable help section with prompting best practices
- **Quick Start Templates**: 6 pre-built templates for common use cases:
  - Customer Satisfaction
  - Employee Feedback
  - Product Feedback
  - Event Evaluation
  - Market Research
  - Training Assessment
- **Recent Prompts**: Automatic saving and reuse of previous prompts (localStorage)
- **Real-time Character Count**: Dynamic character counting
- **Generation & Preview**: AI generation simulation and prompt preview

### 4. Dark/Light Mode Toggle
- Theme toggle button in the top-right
- CSS custom properties for dark mode
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Persistent theme preference (can be extended with localStorage)

### 5. Accessibility Features
- Full keyboard navigation support
- ARIA roles and labels for screen readers
- Focus management and visible focus indicators
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion support for users with motion sensitivity
- Semantic HTML structure

### 6. Enhanced Styling
- Glass morphism effects
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Consistent with Webropol design system
- Custom color palette integration

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript (Alpine.js)
```javascript
// Interface mode management
interfaceMode: 'classic', // 'classic' or 'prompt'

// AI Prompt functionality
aiPrompt: '',
selectedSurveyType: 'survey',
isGenerating: false,
showPromptHelp: false,
recentPrompts: [...],
surveyTypes: [...],
promptTemplates: [...]
```

### Key Methods
- `toggleTheme()`: Switches between light and dark modes
- `generateSurvey()`: Handles AI generation (with simulation)
- `useTemplate(prompt)`: Applies template to prompt area
- `saveRecentPrompt()`: Saves prompts to localStorage
- `previewPrompt()`: Shows prompt preview

### CSS Enhancements
- Dark mode styles with CSS custom properties
- Accessibility improvements (focus, contrast, motion)
- Enhanced animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive design

## Usage Examples

### Classic Interface
Users can click on visual cards to create surveys, events, or access AI features.

### AI Prompt Interface
Users can:
1. Select a survey type
2. Write a natural language prompt
3. Use quick templates or recent prompts
4. Generate surveys with AI assistance

Example prompt:
```
Create a customer satisfaction survey for our mobile app. Include questions about user experience, feature requests, and overall satisfaction. Target 5-7 questions that take no more than 3 minutes to complete.
```

## Integration Points

### Current System
- Maintains compatibility with existing Webropol components
- Uses existing design tokens and color system
- Preserves all current functionality

### Future Enhancements
- Connect to actual AI service endpoints
- Add more survey types
- Expand template library
- Add prompt history search
- Implement collaborative prompting

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers supporting CSS Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- Alpine.js 3.x compatibility

## Files Modified
- `index.html`: Main implementation with tabbed interface
- Added comprehensive CSS for dark mode and accessibility
- Enhanced JavaScript with AI prompt functionality

## Security Considerations
- LocalStorage usage for recent prompts (consider encryption for sensitive data)
- Input sanitization for prompt text
- Rate limiting for AI generation calls (when implemented)

## Performance
- Efficient DOM updates using Alpine.js reactivity
- Lazy loading of templates and content
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size
- Optimized CSS with modern selectors

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test keyboard navigation on both tabs
2. Verify dark/light mode switching
3. Test accessibility with screen readers
4. Validate responsive design on mobile devices
5. Test prompt saving/loading functionality
6. Verify all templates work correctly
